            <h2>Hey, I'm Ian.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I am a creative Graphic Artist and Designer with talent for developing unique custom artwork, as well as being adept at thinking out of the box to generate ideas and concepts. I am experienced in overseeing individual projects as well as brand development collections. In addition, I am capable of expertly researching and developing emerging concepts and trends with the bonus of being Tech-savvy. I strive to be innovative and have a strong record of producing dynamic visuals for print and tangible design, as well as web and digital projects.
            <br>
            During my free time, I like to delve into technological methods and projects, as to keep as up to date on the state of technology as possible and find ways to apply that knowledge to my designs. As well as the technological realm, I also like to delve into other creative endeavors to hone my craft and streamline my creative process as to be able to create any resource I may need, when I need it.
